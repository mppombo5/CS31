1. The square of 1 is 1
The square of 2 is 4
The square of 3 is 9
The square of 4 is 16
The square of 5 is 25
The square of 6 is 36

2. The code doesn't compile correctly because "int k" is a declaration. When you type square(int k), the compiler thinks you're declaring a new int k, not giving it an input of k.

3. The function square(int n) is not reachable by the cout statement because it's inside the int main() function. Since it's not declared in a place where it's reachable by the code, square(k) is undefined and causes unknown behavior.

4. The factorial of 1 is 1
The factorial of 2 is 2
The factorial of 3 is 6
The factorial of 4 is 24
The factorial of 5 is 120
The factorial of 6 is 720

5. The factorial of 1 is 1

The factorial of 3 is 6
The factorial of 4 is 24
The factorial of 5 is 120
The factorial of 6 is 720

Between printFactorial and factorial, I think printFactorial would be much more useful because it gets rid of the extra step of typing "cout <<..." every time you want to print out a factorial.
